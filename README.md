## Dependencies

You will need:
* [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) - windows manager
* [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) - top bar
* [dunst](http://knopwob.org/dunst/index.html) - notifications daemon
* [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) - dynamic dropdown menu
* [nitrogen](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nitrogen) - for setting up the wallpaper
* [colors](http://blog.z3bra.org/2015/06/vomiting-colors.html) - to generate colors palette from wallpaper
* [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - because some scripts are written in it

Optionally (not seen on preview):
* [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) - for fetching updates
* [scrot](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=scrot), [convert](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php), [i3lock](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/) - for the [lockscreen](http://plankenau.com/blog/post/gaussianlock)
* [rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/) - as dmenu replacement (scripts will work with dmenu as well)

## Installation

1. Copy all the files from `PATH` to `/usr/bin` or wherever you have your `$PATH` defined.
2. If the copied files are not executable, run `chmod +x` on them
3. Copy configuration from .config to your `~/.config` directory
4. Add pre-generated resources to your `.Xresources` file: `cat .Xresources | xrdb -merge; xrdb -edit ~/.Xresources`
5. Personalize all the scripts at will

## Bash support

If you would like to make your bash sessions colorful as well,
adding the following code somewhere to your `~/.bashrc` file should do the trick:

```
if [ "$TERM" = "linux" ]; then
    _SEDCMD='s/.*\*generated\([0-9]\{1,\}\).*#\([0-9a-fA-F]\{6\}\).*/\1 \2/p'
    for i in $(sed -n "$_SEDCMD" $HOME/.Xresources | awk '$1 < 16 {printf "\\e]P%X%s", $1, $2}'); do
        echo -en "$i"
    done
    clear
fi
```
